Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

No because both constructors had the exact same parameter type and count ( both signature are DigitalVideoDisc(String) ), Java would not know which one to call then it would cause an error.
