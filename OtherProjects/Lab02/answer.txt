Yes, Java allows it. And this method is called "constructor overloading".

Java can create multiple constructors in the same class, as long as each one has a different parameter list (different number, type, or order of parameters).
For example, both constructors under are valid:
1.public DigitalVideoDisc(String title) {}
2.public DigitalVideoDisc(String category, String title) {}

But if both constructors had the exact same parameter type and count, Java would not know which one to call then it would cause an error.
